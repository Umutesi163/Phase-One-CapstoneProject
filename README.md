# Phase One Capstone Project: University Management System

A logic-driven academic system built with **Java OOP & Collections**, featuring student enrollment, course management, tuition calculation, and file persistence.

# Learning Outcomes
- Applied **OOP principles**: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
- Used **Java Collections** (`List`, `Map`) to model student-course relationships.
- Implemented **custom exceptions** for enrollment rules.
- Enabled **file persistence** using `java.io`.
- Practiced **Git/GitHub** workflows with branching and merging.

#  Features
- Register students and instructors.
- Create and manage courses.
- Enroll students with validation.
- View student records and grades.
- Generate Dean’s List (GPA > 3.5).
- Save/load data via `students.dat` and `courses.dat`.
